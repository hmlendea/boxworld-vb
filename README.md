# BoxWorld

This is the first game I have ever written.
An early attempt at game development, it is a recreation of BoxWorld, written in Visual Basic, many years ago (2011 I think).

Features:
 - A few game levels
 - A basic level editor
 - Record keeping
 - Custom GUI interface
 - A few different texture packs to choose from
 - Multi-language support (Romanian and English)
